I'm a biochemist, passionate about the intersection of science, technology, and business. I have a strong background in genetics and molecular biochemistry, which I've complemented with experience in software development and the application of cutting-edge technologies. I got experience developing software deploying Machine Learning and Neural Networks workflows, Natural Language Processing, and Cloud Tools. 
Actually I spend my time learning Big Data.
My experience ranges from data mining and analysis, creating interactive dashboards and engaging data visualization. I collaborate closely with multidisciplinary teams to identify trends, patterns and opportunities for improvement, driving effective decision making. I'm always looking for new ways to optimize processes and maximize the value of data for my clients. Turn data into competitive advantages and real achievements!

Data are only useful when they are articulated and put at the service of society, I mean, when they acquire informative value. 
My job is to help you collect and organize data so it can then be analyzed to produce useful information for your business.
